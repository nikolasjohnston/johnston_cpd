You can use this if you have a large dataset and only want to use a few of the columns, to keep it simple and tidy. Or, you may want to take a column or two from multiple different datasets and combine them. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nweeds_select <- select(weeds, soil) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis simply creates the weeds_select dataset, seleting one column - \"soil\". As with most tidyverse functions we need to specify the dataset immediately after writing the select function. From here, its simple changes to do use select in new ways  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nweeds_select <- select(weeds,c(soil, species)) # select two columns, \"soil\" and \"species\"\n\nweeds_select <- select(weeds,c(2:4)) # select columns using numbers. In this case, select columns 2 through to 4.\n\nweeds_select <- select(weeds, c(soil:flowers)) # select columns \"soil\" through to \"flowers\"\n\nweeds_select <- select(weeds, -soil) # remove \"soil\"\n# similar syntax applys for removing multiple columns, just place a - infront e.g. select(weeds, -c(2:4))\n\nweeds_select <- select(weeds, starts_with(\"s\")) # select any column whose name starts with S. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are many more like this above example, like \"ends_with\", \"contains\" and \"matches\" all which refer to the column names.  \n\n::: callout\nuse the help window `?select` for more useful functions with `select()`\n:::",
